## Theory :

#### 1. Timer

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The microcontroller oscillator uses quartz crystal for its operation. Even though it is not the simplest solution, there are many reasons to use it. The frequency of such oscillator is precisely defined and very stable, so that pulses it generates are always of the same width, which makes them ideal for time measurement. Such oscillators are also used in quartz watches. If it is necessary to measure time between two events, it is sufficient to count up pulses generated by this oscillator. This is exactly what the timer does. Most programs use these miniature electronic 'stopwatches'. These are commonly 8- or 16-bit SFRs the contents of which are automatically incremented by each coming pulse. Once a register is completely loaded and overflowed, an interrupt may be generated! 

If the timer uses an internal quartz oscillator for its operation then it can be used to measure time between two events (if the register value is A at the moment measurement starts, and B at the moment it terminates, then the elapsed time is equal to the result of subtraction B - A). If registers use pulses coming from external source then such a timer is turned into a counter.
